defmodule Ragex.Analysis.Suggestions.Ranker do
  @moduledoc """
  Priority ranking system for refactoring suggestions.

  Scores suggestions based on multiple factors:
  - **Benefit** (40%): Expected improvement from refactoring
  - **Impact** (20%): Scope of change (number of affected files/modules)
  - **Risk** (20%): Likelihood of introducing bugs (subtracted)
  - **Effort** (10%): Time/complexity to implement (subtracted)
  - **Confidence** (10%): Confidence in the detection

  ## Priority Levels

  - **critical** (score > 0.8): Must address soon, high impact issues
  - **high** (score > 0.6): Important improvements with good ROI
  - **medium** (score > 0.4): Beneficial but not urgent
  - **low** (score > 0.2): Optional improvements
  - **info** (score <= 0.2): For awareness only

  ## Examples
